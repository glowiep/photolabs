# Photolabs 🌇 🌉 🌄
This is a PhotoLabs project for the Web Development React course programming.

PhotoLabs is a React-based single-page application (SPA) that allows users to view photos in different contexts. A pre-existing API is utilized to build a frontend user experience for users to interact with photos.

## ✅ Features
- A user can view photos from the homepage loaded from the API.
- The user can navigate to different photo categories, also called topics.
- The user can like a photo from anywhere within the application where the photo is displayed.
- The user can click on a photo to view a larger version of the photo and relevant / similar photos.

### ⭐ Additional Features
- <b>Viewing Preferences</b>: Users toggle the dark mode switch on the navigation bar.
- <b>Favorites</b>: Users can view their list of favorite photos.
- <b>Search Bar</b>: Users can filter the photos by City.
